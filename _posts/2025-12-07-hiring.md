        Two PhD Positions open
      </h3>

The Discrete Mathematics and Mathematical Programming (DMMP) group at the University of Twente is looking for two PhD candidates to join the research team of Dr. Gaurav Rattan. The positions are funded by the NWO VIDI project Learning on Graphs: Symmetry Meets Structure (LOGSMS).
<br>

The field of Machine Learning on Graphs aims to extract knowledge from graph-structured and network data through powerful machine learning models. LOGSMS will combine diverse tools from discrete mathematics, learning theory and machine learning, thus facilitating the design and analysis of provably powerful graph learning models.
<br>

Strong background in graph theory and graph algorithms is a must. Prior experience in machine learning is highly appreciated, but not obligatory. 
<br>

<b>PhD position 1</b> will focus on developing new graph-theoretic frameworks for analyzing graph learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks or Graph Transformers. We appreciate prior mathematical exposure to at least one of the following topics: random graphs, mathematical logic or statistical learning theory.
<br> 

<b>PhD position 2</b> will focus on designing scalable graph learning models, primarily geared towards assisting combinatorial solvers for practical graph algorithm benchmarks. We appreciate prior experience in implementing deep learning models for graphs and networks.
<br>
