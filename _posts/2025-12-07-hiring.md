        Two PhD Positions open
      </h3>

The Discrete Mathematics and Mathematical Programming (DMMP) group at the University of Twente is looking for two PhD candidates to join the LOGSMS team (<a href="https://utwentecareers.nl/en/vacancies/2332/2x-phd-positions-in-the-mathematical-foundations-of-machine-learning-on-graphs-and-networks/">formal advertisement</a>).
